Why do we exist?
----------------

We exist to glorify God by:

* Expanding gospel ministry in the East of Scotland
* Encouraging Bible believing evangelicals to contend for Biblical Christianity
* Promoting co operation between gospel churches

How do we aim to achieve this?
--------

We seek to do this by:

* Multiplying congregations/fellowships
* Promoting apprenticeship schemes
* Sending people into gospel ministry
* Providing a network of support for gospel churches in the East of Scotland through training for evangelism, church planting and gospel ministry

What difference will this make?
---------

In Jan 2010 we set ourselves five-year goals which include:

* Starting 5 congregations/fellowships from within our partnership
* Training 20 men and women through a ministry apprenticeship scheme
* Enabling the establishment of a suitable full time ministry training course in the East of Scotland
* Sending 15 men and women into gospel ministry 
* A regular programme of events that provide information, support, fellowship and training across the region.

We do not wish to undermine good things going on in our region or encourage people to think in a separatist way, but we do want to encourage those with opportunity to be involved in promoting gospel ministry and providing support for that process.

We are committed to growing gospel ministry by:

* Strengthening existing local churches as we renew our gospel vision and Biblical foundations
* Training members of existing congregations for a wide range of gospel ministries in the local church
* Encouraging suitable gifted men and women to consider going into full time gospel ministry
* Promoting schemes for ministry trainees (apprentices)
* Starting congregations in areas where gospel ministry is weak or non-existent
* Arranging regular opportunities for Church leaders to meet for mutual support, encouragement, prayer, and ongoing ministry training
